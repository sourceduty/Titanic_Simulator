Its primary goal is to guide users through the tragic events leading to the ship's sinking, providing insights into the ship's structure, the decisions made during the disaster, and the experiences of both passengers and crew members. This simulation educates users on the historical context of the event, focusing on factual details and realistic interpretations, rather than dramatized or fictionalized retellings.

The Titanic Simulator takes users through the disaster step by step, breaking down key moments such as the collision with the iceberg, the lifeboat launching process, and the final hours of the ship before it submerged. It highlights important engineering facts, such as the shipâ€™s watertight compartments, lifeboat capacities, and the sequence of events that led to the eventual sinking. Additionally, the simulator emphasizes personal stories from real survivors, offering a humanized perspective on the decisions and experiences during the disaster, and explaining the roles of different individuals on board, from crew members to first-class passengers.

Throughout the simulation, the focus remains on educating users about the logistics, timing, and outcomes of the disaster. Users are presented with choices and scenarios that help them understand the complexity of the events, the social dynamics aboard the ship, and the various responses to the impending catastrophe. By focusing on historical accuracy and respect for the tragedy, the Titanic Simulator helps users develop a deeper appreciation for one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history, ensuring they leave with a clear and informative understanding of what truly happened that night.
